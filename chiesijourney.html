    <h1>Data Science / AI Lab – 5-Week Journey</h1>
    <p>
      A laboratory-style programme for Chiesi staff and university students.
      The goal is to stimulate cross-fertilisation between data specialists,
      data owners, non-technical experts and managers, using two hackathons
      and shared “What if…?” questions to explore responsible innovation.
